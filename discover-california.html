						</header>
						<p style="font-size:x-large;">There are so many things to do and so many attractions and activities that you can do if you come to California.  We can't list them all here, but we can list some of the best places to visit
            if you come to California. First and foremost, because this is a California winery site, of course we suggest that you visit some of the wineries in California.  For this reason, we should suggest Napa Valley and Sonoma as top places 
            to visit if you come to California.  Then, we suggest you visit Los Angeles, where you will find Disneyland, Universal Studios, Hollywood, and more.  Next, we suggest that you visit Yosemite National Park, one of the most 
            famous national parks in the USA. And of course, San Francisco is also a popular tourist destination and you can see the famous Golden Gate Bridge here.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Napa Valley and Sonoma</b><br />
            If you come to California, you definitely want to visit some of our wineries since we have some of the best wineries and best made wines in the world.  Visit Napa Valley and check out some of the wineries there.  When you are in Napa Valley,
            you may also decide to try one of the beautiful golf courses there, or even rent and ride a bike along the Napa Valley Vine Trail.  Next, check out Sonoma, where there are more wineries and where you can indulge in more wine tasting.  While you 
            are in Sonoma, you may also be interested in visiting the Sonoma Coast State Park where there are a lot of beaches next to the Pacific Ocean, or visit the Sears Point Racing Experience where you can learn how to drive a Formula 3 car. If you 
            do decide to visit a winery in either Napa Valley or Sonoma though, make sure you call and book way in advance, to ensure you and your companions have a spot on the day you arrive.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Los Angeles</b><br />
            Come visit Los Angeles while you are also in California.  First and foremost, you can take a trip to the original Disneyland, which was overseen by Walt Disney himself during the initial construction of the park.  Next to Disneyland is the newer 
            Disney California Adventure Park, which will give you more rides, using the theme of California.  Another famous attraction is Universal Studios Hollywood, which will offer you more rides and attractions, but based more on the properties and creations from 
            Universal Studios. And of course, you want to visit Hollywood and check out the Hollywood Walk of Fame.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Yosemite National Park</b><br />
            We also highly suggest a visit to Yosemite National Park, one of the most famous national parks in the US.  You have probably seen some very beautiful pictures of Yosemite already, especially the pictures of the valley in Yosemite. If you visit Yosemite,
            you will see some very breathtaking waterfalls, lakes, and of course, mountains.  If you enjoy outdoors activities, you can do many activities in Yosemite such as hiking, mountain climbing, canoeing, rafting, fishing, and more. Of course, you may also consider 
            camping in Yosemite and enjoying the view when you wake up each day.<br />
            <br />
            <b>San Francisco</b><br />
            San Francisco is another iconic American city.  One of the most famous attractions is the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, which is considered to be one of the modern wonders of the world.  When the Golden Gate Bridge was opened in 1937, it 
            was one of the tallest and longest suspension bridges in the world.  The Golden Gate Bridge connects San Francisco to Marin County.  Next, you may want to visit Fisherman's Wharf, another famous attraction in San Francisco.  Try some of the seafood
            offered at Fisherman's Wharf and many of the seafood restaurants there.  You may also want to visit Alcatraz Island, where Al Capone has even spent some time there.  And of course, you can try one of the iconic cable cars in San Francisco, which is a symbol 
            of San Francisco's history.<br />
