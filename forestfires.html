							<h2>California Forest Fires</h2>
							<span class="byline">The Increasing Problem of Forest Fires in California</span>
						</header>
						<p style="font-size:x-large;">Forest fires are becoming an increasing problem in California.  Typically, most forest fires are started by people, either by accident or on purpose.  The other problem is from forests 
            that become drier, usually because of a prolonged drought and/or drier air conditions.  Winds also play a role in spreading forest fires further and faster.  And of course, climate change has an impact on forest fires
            in California because it is impacting the length of the summer season, as well as influencing when snow melts and even influencing the timing of the late winter rains.<br />
            <br />
            <b>How Forest Fires can Start</b><br />
            The first problem is people that either start a forest fire accidentally and carelessly, or in some cases, even purposefully.  For example, if people go camping, and they don't put out the camp fire properly when they leave
            the campsite, the fire from the camp fire can possibly become the trigger for a wider fire, especially if the winds pick up after the camp goers leave the camp site, and the winds pick up a light object from the camp fire that is already burning. If the light burning object
            is blown into some kindling in a group of drier trees, that can lead to a wider fire.  Cigarette butts are another source of forest fires.  Some smokers just don't properly extinguish their cigarettes and if their lighted cigarette makes contact with the right kindling, the 
            fire can gain momentum and spread further. Chainsaws, weed whackers, and lawnmowers are also sometimes the source of some forest fires, but this would likely be attributed to human error or carelessness in the use of them around forest fire susceptible areas.<br />
            <br />
            Forest fires can also be started deliberately, by act of arson.  Unfortunately, there are some people that would deliberately start a forest fire.  On family trips to the forest, parents should always keep an eye on their children and teach them the dangers of deliberately starting a fire.
            As for adults that start a fire deliberately, that is unfortunate because the damage done by deliberate arson can be enormous, and the number of lives that could be endangered by a deliberate act of arson can also be enormous.  If you see a deliberate act of arson, please report it as soon 
            as possible to the appropriate authorities in your area.<br />
            <br />
            Of course, forest fires can also be started by nature, such as lightning strikes.  So while people can play a part in starting some forest fires, other forest fires are simply started by nature.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Longer, Drier, Hotter Summers, and Prolonged Droughts</b><br />
            Longer, drier, hotter summers also contribute greatly to the increasing forest fires in California, especially extended droughts.  Some of the longer drier summers are a result of climate change.  The summers become longer and drier, while the rainy season is pushed back to later in the year, 
            because of climate change.  The longer and drier summer season results in more droughts and this means there is more tinder and kindling around, and a drier forest in general, which is more susceptible to forest fires. Climate change has also has an effect on the jet stream, which is air 
            current that moves storms and daily weather.  If the jet stream stalls and the weather stalls with it, it can lead to increased drier periods.  And climate change also has an impact on the melting of snow.  The melting snow provides water for the later summer season.  Thus, when the snow melts earlier,
            the period in which the forests can dry out in the summer is also extended.
