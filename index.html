							<span class="byline">California forest fires are getting worse and worse.  Some of it can be attributed to climate change. Sometimes, the culprit are people who are careless with their behavior and something innocent like throwing a small 
              cigarette away without extinguishing it first and leaving the area, can lead to a growing fire.  It also doesn't help if there are dried up plants or wood that serve as tinder, that catch fire easily, and of course, dry weather can contribute to this,
              especially if there is a long period without rain.  And of course, climate change can contribute to an increase in forest fires.  There are many factors that can lead to a forest fire.  To read more about this, please click on the button below.

              <img src="images/picking-grapes.jpg" />
							<span class="byline">The California winery industry employs over 40,000 workers. California winery workers often work in harsh weather to farm the vines and procure the grapes which you can ultimately enjoy in your wine.  We owe a huge debt to the workers who
              make the California wine industry as successful as it is.  While English is used as the main language on many wineries with many workers, there are also a lot of Spanish workers.  Spanish workers make up a significant part of the California economy in general, 
              and many of those Spanish workers work in the California winery industry.  We encourage all winery owners with Spanish workers to learn a little Spanish.  If you are an owner and you need to practice speaking to your Spanish workers, 
              it's recommended that you learn some basic Spanish, for example, from an online Spanish website.

					<p>California wineries have produced some of the best wine in the world and because of this, California wine is known world wide.  Winery is a major sector of the California economy and accounts for some of California's top exports.  Because of this, 
          it's important that climate change and forest fires do not impact the wineries in California or else, it will hurt the California winery industry and ultimately, it will hurt California's economy.  The California winery industry contributes over $57 billion US dollars
          to California's economy and employs over 40,000 people.</p>

							<h2>Climate Change</h2>							
              <img src="images/climate-change.jpg" />
              <span class="byline">Climate change has an adverse effect on California, especially the winery industry.  Ultimately, what can spark a forest fire or make a forest fire worse are prolonged droughts, which dry up alot of the organic material, which ultimately
              serves as tinder for forest fires.  The drier the forests become, the more susceptible they are to fires.  When you have forests that have become drier, and then strong winds swoop in, it leads to a perfect recipe for a forest fire.  If we want to reduce the 
              severity of forest fires, the world needs to tackle the problem of climate change and treat it as a high priority problem.</span>
