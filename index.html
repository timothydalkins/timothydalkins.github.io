							<span class="byline">Forest fires are becoming an increasing problem in California.  Typically, most forest fires are started by people, either by accident or on purpose.  The other problem is from forests 
              that become drier, usually because of a prolonged drought and/or drier air conditions.  Winds also play a role in spreading forest fires further and faster, such as the winds picking up burning debris and then spreading the fire to new areas.  
              And of course, climate change has an impact on forest fires in California because it is impacting the length of the summer season, as well as influencing when snow melts and even influencing the timing of the late winter rains.  
              There are many factors that are contributing to California forest fires.  To read more about this, please click on the button below.

						<h2>Workers in the California Winery Industry</h2>

          <img src="images/picking-grapes.jpg" class="imgClass"/>
					<p>The California winery industry employs over 34,000 workers. California winery workers often work in harsh weather to farm the vines and procure the grapes which you can ultimately enjoy in your wine.  We owe a huge debt to the workers who
              make the California wine industry as successful as it is.  While English is used as the main language on many wineries with many workers, there are also a lot of Spanish workers.  Spanish workers make up a significant part of the California economy in general, 
              and many of those Spanish workers work in the California winery industry.  We encourage all winery owners with Spanish workers to learn a little Spanish.  If you are an owner and you need to practice speaking to your Spanish workers, 
              it's recommended that you learn some basic Spanish, for example, from an online Spanish website.</p>

              <span class="byline">Climate change has an adverse effect on California, especially the winery industry.  Ultimately, what can spark a forest fire or make a forest fire worse are prolonged droughts, which dry up a lot of the organic material, which ultimately
              serves as tinder or kindling for forest fires.  The drier the forests become, the more susceptible they are to fires.  When you have forests that have become drier, and then strong winds swoop in, it leads to a perfect recipe for a forest fire.  If we want to reduce the 
              severity of forest fires, the world needs to tackle the problem of climate change and treat it as a high priority problem.</span>

							<h2>California Wineries</h2>							
              <img src="images/vineyard.jpg" class="imgClass"/>
              <span class="byline">California wineries have produced some of the best wine in the world and because of this, California wine is known worldwide.  Winery is a major sector of the California economy and accounts for some of the state's top exports.  Because of this, 
               it's important that climate change and forest fires do not impact the wineries in California or else, it will hurt the winery industry and ultimately, it will hurt the state's economy.  The winery industry contributes over 
               <a href="http://www.wine-economy.com/media/1050/2015-california-wine-economic-impact-methodology.pdf">$57.6 billion US dollars to California's economy and employs over 34,000 people</a>, so the winery industry makes up a very large part of the state's economy and 
               provides many jobs for its residents.</span>

					<p>California is such a beautiful state and we definitely encourage people to visit our lovely state. Of course, if you come to California, we would suggest that you visit one of the wineries in California where you can relax, take a sip of wine, and learn more about the 
          wine making process.  Napa Valley and Sonoma are top destinations to visit if you come to California, in addition to all the wineries based in Napa Valley and Sonoma.  Aside from wineries, there are many other places to visit, including Yosemite National Park, 
          Los Angeles, San Francisco, and more.  In Los Angeles itself, there is Disneyland, Universal Studios, and Hollywood, which are famous tourist attractions.  And for San Francisco, there is the iconic Golden Gate Bridge.  Come visit California, comes visit our wineries,
          and visit more of what our state has to offer.</p>
